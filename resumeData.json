    "bio": "Hi there! I am Tina! During my study at my previous university, I joined the Google DSC and it sparked my interests in front-end development. Since then I have been self-learning Figma, CSS, HTML, Javascript, and React, and I will take related university courses in the following terms as an Information Systems student. I have also learnt object-oriented programming in C++, Java, and database management. Besides my academics, while working at ShopBack, I often needed to communicate suggestions for improvement in UX and more efficient testing workflow among my supervisors, managers, and colleagues. These experiences have helped me develop both my UI/UX and object-oriented programming skills.",
